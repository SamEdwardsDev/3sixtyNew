                  Cold applied road markings/ MMA Coloured surface paint MMA
                  (Methyl Methacrylate) is an extremely durable product usually
                  used at high stress traffic locations such as roundabouts,
                  junctions and heavily trafficked roads. MMA provides a tough
                  and an exceptional anti-slip surface on interior surfaces or
                  exterior asphalt, resistant to mechanical stress and many
                  chemicals including fuels, oils and lubricants.

                <h2>HIGH FRICTION SURFACING</h2>
                <p>
                  HFS (High friction surfacing) is a proven road surface
                  treatment that increases skid resistance and reduces braking
                  distance thereby reducing the potential for accidents. With a
                  skid accident reduction of over 50% it saves lives and money.
                  This is available in a range of colours to offer a visual
                  demarcation as well as a high performing surface.

                <h2>SPRAY</h2>
                <p>
                  Spray painting lays down a perfect smooth high end finish
                  every time, ideal for warehouses, garages, and other
                  industrial floors and creates a finish with no streaks or
                  imperfections. Spray road markings offer benefits in terms of
                  maintenance compared to thermoplastic as the application is
                  thinner meaning there is less cause for intrusive removal.
